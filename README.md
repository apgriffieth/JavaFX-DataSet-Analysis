# JavaFX-DataSet-Analysis
Developed as a group with Tyler Neerings and Khang Vo, this project performs analysis of a dataset with an easy to use interface. Data can either be imported through a .csv or .txt file or created manually by adding values one by one. Boundaries of accepted values can be adjusted and once data has been entered, the dataset can be displayed, shown as a graph, the distribution of values can be shown, and the dataset can be analyzed to show useful information such as the number of entries, highest/lowest values, mean, median, and mode. Additionally, an error log is kept for each dataset that can be viewed at anytime and is automatically cleared with a new dataset, and a report of the dataset can be created which generates a text file holding all useful information of the dataset.
